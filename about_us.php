    <h1>About US</h1>
    <p>This is a site for bartering where people can post items that they want to trade and browse items that others have to trade. People can browse by item category (cars, services, books, furniture, etc.), by user, or just free-form browse through everything on the site. The idea is to expedite barter transactions between users by finding matches for the trade items.</p><br />
